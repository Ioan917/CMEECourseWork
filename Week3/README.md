## Project structure and Usage
### Code
* apply1.R: Using apply on some of R's inbuilt functions.
* apply2.R: Using apply to define my own function.
* basic_io.R: Code to import a data file, remove column names and save as a new version in a new directory.
* boilerplate.R: First example of an R function; passing arguments to print their class.
* break.R: A while loop to illustrate the use of break in breaking out of loops.
* browse.R: Example of using browser() to insert a breakpoint in a for loop.
* control_flow.R: Control flow tools: if else statements, for and while loops.
* next.R: A for loop to illustrate the use of next in passing to the next iteration of a loop.
* preallocate.R: Two functions demonstrating the difference in memory allocation and therefore the speed of operations.
* R_conditionals.R: Three examples of using functions with conditionals: is.even, is.power2, is.prime.
* sample.R: Example of vectorization involving lapply and sapply. Learning how sampling random numbers work.
* TreeHeight.R: Using a simple function to calculate the height of trees from the trees.csv file and saving the result in TreeHts.csv.
* try.R: Code illustrating the try keyword to allow a program to continue despite an error and return a set error message.
* Vectorize.R: Example script to illustrate the differences in speed of loops and the use of vectorization.
### Data
* trees.csv: Test file for practicing importing and exporting data.
### Results
* MyData.csv: Test file for practicing writing to and saving a file.
* TreeHts.csv: Output of TreeHeight.R practical, includes a new column with the calculated tree height values.
