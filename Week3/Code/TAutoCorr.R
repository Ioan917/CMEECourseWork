## Examine data

# Repeat the calculation 10,000 times by randomly permuting the time series and 
# then recalculating the correlation coefficient for each randomly permuted year 
# sequence and storing it
# use sample function

# Calculate what fraction of the correlation coefficients from the previous step 
# were greater than that from step 1 - appropriate p-value
