        \caption{The percentage number of IDs where each mechanistic model was the best fitted model among the candidate of models (Type I, II, III and Generalised functional response models); based on \textbf{a} AICc and \textbf{b} BIC. The best fitted model was defined as: if a model had the lower \textbf{a} AICc or \textbf{b} BIC value and $\Delta$AIC\textgreater2 or $\Delta$BIC\textgreater2 for all pairwise comparisons. IDs which did not have a consistent winner (i.e. had models that won some comparisons but not all) were labelled draws.}

        \includegraphics[width=14cm]{AW_frequency}\label{fig:4}
        \centering
        \caption{The frequency of Akaike Weights (which have been calculated for each ID) for each of the mechanistic models: \textbf{a} Holling's Type I, \textbf{b} Type II, \textbf{c} Type III and \textbf{d} Generalised functional response. Akaike Weights were normalised across the candidate set of models to sum to 1. Akaike Weights describe the probability that a model is the best model given the candidate set of models (the mechanistic models). An Akaike Weight of 1 suggests unambigous support for the model by the data.}
