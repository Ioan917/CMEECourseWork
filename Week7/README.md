* numpy
* re
* scipy
* scipy.integrate
* subprocess
* time
* timeit
## Installation
No specific instructions.
## Project structure and Usage
### Code
* blackbirds.py: Practical exercise on regular expressions.
* fmr.R: Practice script used in run_fmr_r.py that find and plots linear regressions.
* LV1.py: Practical exercise exemplifying the use of scipy for numerical integration to explore the Lotka-Volterra model. This script produces two figures that, when the code is run, are saved to the Results directory.
* LV2.py: Practical exercise expanding on LV1.py to include density dependence.
* MYFirstJupyterNotebook.ipynb: First Jupyter notebook script practicing basic operations.
* profileme.py: Example code to practice profiling.
* profileme2.py: Example code making imporvements on the profileme.py script based on information from pofiling.
* regexs.py: Code exemplifying the use of regular expressions.
* run_fmr_R.py: Code exemplifying the use of subprocess to run an R script.
* run_LV1_LV2.py: Practical exercise torun LV1.py and LV2.py with appropriate arguments and to profile both scripts.
* TestR.py: Code exemplifying the use of the subprocess package to run R scripts from python. 
* TestR.R: Simple R code to used in the TestR.py script.
* timeitme.py: Example code comparing the run time of functions from profileme.py and profileme2.py using the timeit module.
* using_os.py: Practical exercise listing directories, subdirectories and files.
### Data
* blackbirds.txt: Taxonomic data used in the blackbirds.py practical.
* NagyEtAl1999.csv: Taxonomic, mass and energy data used in the fmr.R script.
### Results
All results files are created by running the respective script.
