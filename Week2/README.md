# Week2
## Brief description
Code and data files for the second week of the CMEE course, covering the first week of python scripting.
## Languages
* Python
## Dependencies
* csv
* ipdb
* sys
## Installation
No specific instructions for installing the project.
## Project structure and Usage
### Code
* align_seqs.py: Practical exercise adapting a python script to enable import and export of data files. The resulting program find the best alignment of 2 strings (DNA sequences) and prints the best alignment and score to a .txt file.
* basic_csv.py: Functions demonstrating the use of the csv package to manipulate CSV files in python. Creating a new CSV cile with a subset of the data of the testcsv.csv file.
* basic_io1.py: Example of importing a file into python.
* basic_io2.py: Example of exporting a file from python.
* basic_io3.py: Example of stroing objects in python.
* boilerplate.py: Code template for writing python programs.
* cfexercises1.py: Practical exercise exploring control statements and example modified script to be more module-like.
* cfexercises2.py: Functions exemplifying the combined use of conditionals and loops.
* control_flow.py: Some functions exemplifying the use of control statements.
* debugme.py: Some functions used to test the use of %pdb in debugging and try / except statements.
* dictionary.py: Practical exercise converting a taxa dataset into a new distionary structural format.
* lc1.py: Practical exercise creating list comprehensions and conventional loops to manipulate a bird dataset.
* lc2.py: Practical exercise creating list comprehensions and conventional loops to manipulate a temperature by month dataset.
* loops.py: Exploring the use of for and while loops in python.
* oaks.py: Exercise comparing the use of conventional loops and list comprehensions to execute the same functions.
* scope.py: Examples of creating and using global and local variables.
* sys.argv.py: A short script exemplifying the use of argument variables. 
* test_control_flow.py: Some functions exemplifying the use of control flow.
* tuple.py: Practical exercise creating a script to convert a bird dataset into a new structural format.
* using_name.py: Example to demonstrate of the use of name in python programs.
### Data
* bodymass.csv: Subset of the testcsv.csv file, made by running the code in basic_csv.csv.
* test.txt: Test file used to practice importing data into python. Moved from Sandbox file because file is needed to run basic_io1.py.
* testcsv.csv: Species, Infraorder, Family, Distribution, Body mass male (Kg) data used in basic_csv.csv to test the csv package.
* testp.p: Test file used as an example of storing objects in python. Moved from Sandbox file because file is needed to run basic_io3.py.
* TestSeq.csv: Default sequences to be used for the align_seqs.py practical.
### Results
Empty file.
