## Brief description
Code and data files for the second week of the CMEE course, covering the first week of python scripting.
## Languages
* Python
## Dependencies
* csv
* ipdb
* sys
## Installation
No specific instructions for installing the project.
## Project structure and Usage
### Code
* align_seqs.py: Practical exercise adapting a python script to enable import and export of data files. The resulting program find the best alignment of 2 strings (DNA sequences) and prints the best alignment and score to a .txt file.
* align_seqs_better.py: Finds the best alignment of two DNA sequences (ie. the alignment with the most matched bases) from two inputted FASTA files. If multiple best matches, it outputs all of them. Writes the alignment(s) and the number of matches to a file.
* align_seqs_fasta.py: Finds the best alignment of two DNA sequences (ie. the alignment with the most matched bases) from two inputted FASTA files. Writes the alignment and the number of matches to a file.
* basic_csv.py: Functions demonstrating the use of the csv package to manipulate CSV files in python. Creating a new CSV cile with a subset of the data of the testcsv.csv file.
* basic_io1.py: Example of importing a file into python.
* basic_io2.py: Example of exporting a file from python.
* basic_io3.py: Example of stroing objects in python.
* boilerplate.py: Code template for writing python programs.
* cfexercises1.py: Practical exercise exploring control statements and example modified script to be more module-like.
* cfexercises2.py: Functions exemplifying the combined use of conditionals and loops.
* control_flow.py: Some functions exemplifying the use of control statements.
* debugme.py: Some functions used to test the use of %pdb in debugging and try / except statements.
* dictionary.py: Practical exercise converting a taxa dataset into a new distionary structural format.
* lc1.py: Practical exercise creating list comprehensions and conventional loops to manipulate a bird dataset.
* lc2.py: Practical exercise creating list comprehensions and conventional loops to manipulate a temperature by month dataset.
* loops.py: Exploring the use of for and while loops in python.
* oaks.py: Exercise comparing the use of conventional loops and list comprehensions to execute the same functions.
* oaks_debugme.py: Groupwork exercise on identifying Oaks in a dataset of trees.
* scope.py: Examples of creating and using global and local variables.
* sys.argv.py: A short script exemplifying the use of argument variables. 
* test_control_flow.py: Some functions exemplifying the use of control flow.
* tuple.py: Practical exercise creating a script to convert a bird dataset into a new structural format.
* using_name.py: Example to demonstrate of the use of name in python programs.
### Data
* 407228326.fasta: Genomic data for UnixPrac1.txt.
* 407228412.fasta: Genomic data for UnixPrac1.txt.
* E.coli.fasta: Genomic data for UnixPrac1.txt.
* test.txt: Test file used to practice importing data into python. Moved from Sandbox file because file is needed to run basic_io1.py.
* testcsv.csv: Species, Infraorder, Family, Distribution, Body mass male (Kg) data used in basic_csv.csv to test the csv package.
* TestOaks.csv: Tree data for the oaks_debugme.py practical exercise script.
* testp.p: Test file used as an example of storing objects in python. Moved from Sandbox file because file is needed to run basic_io3.py.
* TestSeq.csv: Default sequences to be used for the align_seqs.py practical.
### Results
Empty file.
